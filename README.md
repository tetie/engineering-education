“Section's Engineering Education (EngEd) Program is dedicated to offering a unique quality community experience for computer science university students." 

[ENROLL HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTbj3kqvEJEb5RLjqJurfbHa8ckzQx0CjRzaizblue9ZOK5A/viewform?usp=sf_link)

### Program Purpose
The program was created to promote and cultivate relevant career building/skill enrichment resources, a community for students to share their knowledge with peers around the world, and to help catapult their careers.”

EngEd community content can be found at [https://section.io/engineering-education](https://section.io/engineering-education).

The Section team will monitor and manage the overall Program.

### Program Requirements
Section partners with university computer science programs across the globe to create a community which is useful for engineers of every (any) level preparing to enter the DEV workforce.

To join the program, we ask that students be part of a university level CS class or program.

### Program Resources
- Be sure to sign up to the Section Community Slack Channel at [slack.section.io](https://sectionio-community.slack.com/). Once signed up, join the **#eng-ed** channel for ongoing program communications.

### EngEd Community Contribution Initiative
One of our primary goals for the EngEd community is to provide students/contributors a friendly and inviting place to contribute to real-world projects to help students build up their professional portfolios and profiles (upon entering the DEV career space). 

We have created a process for the EngEd community to suggest, contribute, add, and build features for the EngEd community. 
By allowing the community to build the features/enhancements they want to see in the EngEd program, we can create the best community.

This initiative works on increasing and building upon the skills the community already has in a real world setting, and having a place to showcase those achievements and accomplishments (via the EngEd content program). 

This Contribution Initiative is strictly restricted to the EngEd community. 

### EngEd Community Contribution Submission Process
1. To submit an EngEd feature contribution for consideration, be sure to first check [past feature suggestons](https://github.com/section-engineering-education/engineering-education/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) to ensure relevance and prevent overlap. **Hint**: Use the this EngEd Content Suggestion form to propose article topic for approval and get feedback on topic ideas. [*View content form here*](https://github.com/section-engineering-education/engineering-education/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=enged-feature-suggestion.md&title=Feature+suggestion)
2. When you're ready to submit a suggestion for review, submit your issue with details on what you would like to see added to the EngEd application/program. 
3. Suggestions will be reviewed by the Section team for relevance, and quality. 
4. Once suggested features have been incorporated into our backlog, the Section team will approve your issue and create a pull request to be worked on by the EngEd community.

### EngEd Article Submission Process
We also have an EngEd Article Submission Process that allows our contributors to submit (and publish) a community-generated pool of content which is valuable for engineers of every (any) level.

This is in an effort to provide students a medium to showcase their skills, profiles, and contributed works to any potential employers. 

Students are expected to contribute fully polished and ready to be published (by *fully polished and ready to be published articles* we mean pull request that are submitted in FINAL form draft. Pull requests that require **moderate to major review/revision will either be CLOSED**.

### Submission Instructions
1. To submit an article for consideration, be sure to first check [published content](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/) to ensure relevance and prevent overlap. **Hint**: Use the this EngEd Content Suggestion form to propose article topic for approval and get feedback on topic ideas. [*View content form here*](https://github.com/section-io/engineering-education/issues/new?assignees=&labels=topic+suggestion&template=enged-content-idea-suggestion.md&title=)
2. When you're ready to submit a polished (error-free) draft for review, open a PR with your draft. [*View instructions here*](https://github.com/section-io/engineering-education/blob/master/new_contributors/UPLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
3. Articles will be reviewed by the Section team for technical accuracy, relevance, and quality. (We need to be sure we're continuing to build value for our fellow engineering community as a trusted source of content.) Comments and requested revisions will be provided within the open PR.
4. Once suggested edits have been incorporated, the Section team will approve your PR and the draft will move to our publishing queue.
5. Once your article has been published, we ask you monitor your work for incoming comments and questions left by readers.

### Help Us Help All
We can only improve and add value by working together with our community. Please help us iterate on our processes so that we can grow this program to enrich the larger engineering community. If you see something that needs attention, please submit an issue so we can address it in a timely manner.
