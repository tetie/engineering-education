The cloud-native software development approach is increasingly becoming popular. Its design methodology facilitates the creation and deployment of applications in the cloud rather than in physical servers.
<!--more-->
Its architecture allows developers to build, run, and update software using several independent microservices. The cloud-native architecture utilizes the cloud and DevOps to deliver codeless infrastructure that supports modern enterprise requirements.

Kubernetes is integral in this process therefore it dominates the cloud-native architecture program. The goal of relying on Kubernetes for cloud-native infrastructure is to guarantee high scalability according to the needs of an organization.

### What it means to be cloud-native
Cloud-native refers to building and deploying app software to exploit the cloud delivery model is distributed computing. With cloud-native technologies, you can build and run scalable apps in private, public, and hybrid clouds.

An in-depth assessment of what it means to be cloud-native focuses on three aspects:
- Agility
- Speed of delivery
- Scalability

#### Better agility
Being cloud-native comes with the advantage of improved agility. Real value emanates from an organization's ability to rapidly and securely build and deploy systems in a fast-paced business environment.

Taking an automated and cloud-native approach facilitates the faster release of systems without taking services offline for maintenance.

The high agility of cloud-native infrastructure means a company can have a continual and automated monitoring service that ensures overall system functionality.

#### Speedy software delivery
Cloud-native apps operate on a continuous delivery model, allowing for quickly shipping software updates.

With the tech market-changing tremendously, businesses and individuals continue to crave a faster service delivery. Cloud-native operates on an automated mode of delivery, thus guaranteeing speedy software delivery.

With cloud-native utilizing container [orchestrators](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/get-started-with-cloud-native/) like Kubernetes, there will be less downtime, ensuring faster and more reliable processes.

#### Scalability
One of the most significant reasons you should consider the cloud hosting infrastructure is scalability.

Scalability allows for the acceptance of additional user load without compromising the performance of a system. Cloud-native offers a limitless scaling of computing and storage.

The scalability ensures that developers enjoy a lower-risk method for reverting changes since they can always rely on the cloud to recover previous versions of the workload.

Cloud-native is crucial in the innovative efforts of companies and contributes to increased competitiveness and improved quality of service.

### Kubernetes at the heart of enterprise architectures
Cloud-native architecture's ability to take advantage of both the DevOps and the cloud makes it fit for many enterprise infrastructures. Organizations rely on ecosystems with open-source solutions to create and deploy scalable applications.

Kubernetes forms a critical pillar of the open-source system essential in running cloud-native software. It can scale up or down to the current needs, enhancing the automation process when running applications.

Essentially, Kubernetes eliminates downtime, facilitating swift operations within an enterprise framework.

### What makes Kubernetes a good fit for enterprise architectures?
Kubernetes offers an automated [CI/CD](https://faun.pub/benefits-of-kubernetes-for-microservices-architecture-99a82b3919f3) procedure that supports Microservices architecture.

It guarantees the smooth running and management of these procedures, enabling enterprises to operate apps efficiently. Microservice infrastructure is vital in building an application or software because it couples up several services that make an app functional.

Kubernetes enhances the resiliency and fault tolerance of applications. In particular, it works in association with other tools like Docker to implement containers that help manage disparate resources, storage distributions, isolated settings, etc.

Kubernetes significantly assists when dealing with application and software configurations through this involvement. It also helps enterprises execute metric gathering and tracing and centralized logging systems.

Kubernetes' complementarity with Docker indicates the need for enterprises to adopt Kubernetes to build systems. Years ago, Docker Engine helped develop ways to enable developers separate app dependencies from the underlying operating system and infrastructure.

Docker containers have been successful, and several entities and individuals use them worldwide. They are a critical building block for the modern app infrastructure.

With Docker linking up with Kubernetes, enterprise architecture will undoubtedly rely on Kubernetes, which will offer better and more satisfactory application container capabilities.

More than [70%](https://containerjournal.com/topics/why-kubernetes-is-the-king-of-containerized-tools/) of organizations will be using not less than two containerized applications by 2023. The high rate means that Kubernetes has received widespread acceptance.

The Kubernetes revolution will continue with estimates indicating that the percentages of the number of organizations that rely on this technology will rise. Kubernetes keeps getting better, which is advantageous to any firm that utilizes the technology.

### The power of cloud-native open-source Kubernetes
Cloud-native open-source technologies utilize the capabilities of the cloud and Kubernetes to create a more robust system.

The advantages that cloud technologies offer are notable, including the high scalability and availability that help drive competitive advantage.

Now Kubernetes powers the advantages previously tasked to the cloud tech and guarantees remarkable benefits to the enterprises without the risk of vendor lock-in.

Because of cloud-native open-source Kubernetes, organizations will save on the required effort and time to provide, configure, manage, and phase-out infrastructural resources.

DevOps teams can now automate code pushes and unit testing, providing continuous integration while experiencing no downtime during the deployment of applications and software.

This Kubernetes capability allows developers to dedicate their time to solving business problems. They can ship code faster and increase innovation.

The extensible and reliable nature of Kubernetes-based architectures empowers developers to introduce new products and add features to existing products without risking company operations.

An enterprise can update an application's functionality without the need to rebuild code in its entirety each time. This is a result of Kubernetes' microservices-based containerized application capabilities.

### Conclusion
Cloud-native architectures leverage the DevOps best practices and the cloud capabilities to deliver an excellent infrastructure and facilitate application framework.

Kubernetes remains at the center of this advancement. It has become a dominant technology, and many enterprises have embraced it. Kubernetes has transformed the cloud into a more robust framework that facilitates greater scalability and speedy application development delivery.

Kubernetes has helped enterprises move towards cost-effective infrastructure. They now have a chance to redirect their funds towards innovative practices to enhance the performance of their software and applications.

Kubernetes gives the tech-reliant firms a viable option for monitoring resource utilization and the capability for auto-recovery and scalability for their DevOps teams.

Happy learning!
