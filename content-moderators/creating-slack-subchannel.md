### Creating a Slack Sub-Channel
Any EngEd student that may be interested in creating/moderating a Slack sub-channel for the community can do so by reaching out via a DM in Slack to get started. 

Think of a sub-channel topic that you believe the community is really excited about or a topic the larger DEV community is talking about. Eg: ML & blockchain.

This community created channel would be an open space for the community to share their thoughts on the topic at hand. What they like, what they come across, topics they have read about, where people can share talks, podcasts, anything related to the topic at hand.

A goal for the sub-channel is to create a conducive environment for healthy discussion on topics students like.

This is an **opportunity to be seen as a leader within a topic space** a creating a lively discussion around a topic you would be interested in exploring.
It would also look extremely well on you CV.

In the future (once the channel gains some momentum) we can look into organizing  hackathons, events, or webinars out of this sub-channel if the opporunity develops.

### Role Commitment 
~5-10 a week. (All flexible since this is a volunteer role). Any where between an hour or two a day.

As things evolve in the sub-channel other opportunities may present itself (such as potential future sub-channel based events) is the students in the channel/community would like to get that up and running.

Weâ€™re trying to build a space where students want to come spend time and learn, discuss, & share topics that interests them.

### Process to get started
- Reach out to Community Manager via a Slack DM - with Topic idea to get approved. 
- Once approved go ahead a create the channel (short and sweet eg: block-chain, machine-learning)
- Add the channel description (towards the top there is an option to add a description).
- Draft up an announcement to share with the community (#eng-ed channel).
- Start inviting community memembers that you believe would be interested in the dicussion.

### Duties & Responsibilities:
- Help answer questions with relevant EngEd (or outside) related articles and
resources.

discussion.
Greet new channel members and invite fellow peers who would benefit from the
group discussion.
- Sharing relevant and relating article topics (w/links)  you come across that you think
would be interesting to the channel members or would provoke some lively
discussion.

related and would be of value.
- Any way that we can bring this full circle to include EngEd resources always a
plus.
