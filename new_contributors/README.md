### EngEd Program Overview
Welcome to Section's Engineering Education (EngEd) Program, the program was created to promote and cultivate relevant career building/skill enrichment resources, a community for students to share their knowledge with peers around the world, and to help catapult their careers.

Let's begin by creating your [EngEd profile](https://github.com/section-engineering-education/engineering-education/blob/master/new_contributors/enged-author-profile-guidelines.md). This profile can be used as a valuable reference to share with peers, potential employers, and the broader technology community. It is important to update it and keep it presentable.

We also want to make sure you receive credit for all your hard work.

Be sure to include a short Author Biography and Headshot image. Please include the files in the authors folder within the GitHub repo.

The Section team will monitor and manage the overall Program.

EngEd community content can be found at https://section.io/engineering-education. Any new articles/topics to be published need to be submitted and approved via a topic form [here](https://github.com/section-engineering-education/engineering-education/issues/new?assignees=&labels=topic+suggestion&template=enged-content-idea-suggestion.md&title=).

The main criteria that we're using to evaluate any incoming articles/tutorials to be published include:
- Polish and depth of the description and key takeaways provided - Grammar, readability, and substance are all being reviewed. Be sure to treat your topic suggestion as the best representation of your writing.
- Originality - We're looking for unique content that isn't readily available through existing documentation and wikipedia definitions. Consider applying concepts to unique projects.
- Programming-centric topics in the web technologies space - We're most interested in articles that take a practitioner's approach to solving common (and not so common) challenges in the modern technology ecosystem. We tend to lean more heavily towards meaty front- and back-end technology-related content and are generally less interested in tangential technology topics, such as UI design and hardware.
